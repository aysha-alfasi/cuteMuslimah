            <p class="large"> On a wonderful very early morning the Sun called me and i looked towards
                it, and I saw in its soft and strong rays the meaning of life. As the spirit of the life
                is beautiful like it. Life is thus its strenght is soft, and Its softness is strong.
                Softness and strengh are not opposite, but on the contrary both are things that
                cannot be understood without the existence of the other one.

                        <p class="large"> When you get a wonderful meaning, or lets say
                            when you understand it finally it's an great memory
                            in that moment we get an extra life, as wisdom increases our life
                            in a diffirent words it increases the value and the quality of our life

                            When you get a wonderful meaning, or lets say
                            when you understand it finally it's an great memory
                            in that moment we get an extra life, as wisdom increases our life
                            in a diffirent words it increases the value and the quality of our life
                            in this regard i will tell you what this lovely tree tought me.
                            I saw the sky twice in the same place and under the same trees
                            the first time the sky was obscured from me by the branches of the trees
                            <br><br>
                            <img src="imgs/image5406h.png">
                            <br><br>
                            it was difficult to see the beautiful horizon, at that time a person might
                            feel as if he was in a prison, how would a person live if the sky was
                            obscured from him? What is our feeling towards these branches that prevent
                            us from seeing the sky and the birds? Will it be possible to see its beauty
                            or some of its positive aspects that every creature carries? But a moment..
                            before continuing with these bitter questions
                            <br><br>
                            <img src="imgs/image5979.png">

                            Here is the tree opens a gate to heaven for us! And at that moment,
                            I felt that the universe welcomed me, the clouds, birds, and the
                            tree branches where clapping to me by the sounds of their laughter
                            with the breeze, and then I discovered that those branches in the
                            first picture were not a prison or something that calls for frustration
                            or anger, on the contrary, they are the obstacles that we face in life
                            and which we are because of it a better copy of ourselves, the
                            difficult situations that happen to us, not only teach us and
                            give us wisdom, but also give us a more beautiful life, because
                            life is awareness, and when we are in a state of awareness, we
                            are really alive, meaning that we are actually living!
                            Therefore, when I saw the sky in the second image it was
                            indescribably amazing and joyful, because the first image
                            made me think and meditate, and after I became closer to
                            realization I became ready for the awareness and tasted
                            an amazing sense of life.
